# Symbol mapping (special font for specified unicode code points). Map the

# in hexadecimal>. You can specify multiple code points, separated by commas
# and ranges separated by hyphens. symbol_map itself can be specified multiple times.
# Syntax is:

#
# symbol_map U+E0A0-U+E0A2,U+E0B0-U+E0B3 PowerlineSymbols

# Performance tuning {{{
# Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it, increases
# frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage. The default value

# monitor with a high refresh rate.
repaint_delay    10

# Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in the terminal
# is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase responsiveness, but also
# increase CPU usage and might cause flicker in full screen programs that
# redraw the entire screen on each loop, because kitty is so fast that partial
# screen updates will be drawn.
input_delay 3

# Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This prevents
# tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing) when scrolling. However,
